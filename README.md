# A Gradient Boosting Approach for Training Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks 	

GB-CNN is the python library for working with Gradient Boosted - Convolutional Neural Networks (GB-CNN) and Gradient Boosted Deep Neural Networks (GB-DNN).

* **GB-CNN** is designed to implement the Gradient Boosted Convolutional layers for the *image* datasets.

* **GB-DNN** is designed to implement the Gradient Boosted Dense layers for the big dimension *tabular* datasets.
